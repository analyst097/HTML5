        <h1>Image tag</h1>
        <p>It's better to modify the actual image file if possible rather modifying width and height.<br>
            Reducing size of the actual image reduces the file size which leads to faster loading of web page.<br>
            It's also helpful in displaying accurate size of image we need.

        <h1>Favicons</h1>
        <p>
            To add icons to title of our webpage we need to add a link in the &lt;head&gt; tag with a<br>
            .png or special icon image only.
        </p>

        <h1>Alternative Text</h1>
        <p> Creating good alternative text is almost an art. The good news is that it is an art that even 
        artistically-challenged people like myself can do well. The key is to think about the meanings
         behind your images, not a description of them. So here are some tips:
        </p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decide what information the image conveys: Does someone need to see the page to understand your
                 message? If not, you can treat the image as decorative use a null (empty) text alternative (alt=""). 
                Make sure not to include a space inside the quotes since some screen readers may then read it aloud.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the image is information, be complete, but concise: In most cases you should be able to 
                use a short phrase or sentence as alt text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prioritize information in text alternative: Aim to put the most important information 
                at the beginning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid superfluous information: There is rarely a need to use the words “image”, “icon”, 
                or “picture” in the alt text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Handle complex images as a special case: Complex images such as graphs, charts, maps,
                 and illustrations contain substantial information – more than can be conveyed in a 
                 short phrase or sentence. In these cases, a two-part text alternative is required. 
                 The first part is the short description to identify the image and, where appropriate, 
                 indicate the location of the long description. The second part is the long description –
                  a textual representation of the essential information conveyed by the image.

            </li>
        </ul>
